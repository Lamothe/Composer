# Composer
A UWP based multi-track music recorder for Windows written in C#.
The UI layout is similar to Audacity however the workflow is designed for creating and looping multi-instrument music with your old Windows PC/laptop.
Individual bars can be copied and pasted and then grouped and looped over to create backing tracks.

## Features (Current)
* Bar-based recording
* All-track playback
* Delete track

## TODO
These are the things that need to be done before the application is "feature complete":
* Bug: Multitrack (more than 3) playback sounds choppy like the computer isn't keeping up
* Save
* Keyboard shortcuts
* Mute track
* Solo playback
* Playback marker
* Delete bar
* Cut/copy/paste bar
* Loop bars
* Select BPM, currently fixed at 120
* Select beats per bar, currently set at 4
* Metronome
* Track playback volume
* Minimal effects - Eq, reverb, delay
* Touch based operation
* Pedal controls

## Limitations
Here are a list features that I'm not planning to implement:
* Guitar effects (instead, use something like a Boss GT-1)
* Compositions with changing time signatures.

Pull requests are welcomed.
