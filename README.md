# Composer
A UWP based multi-track music recorder for Windows written in C#.
The UI layout is similar to Audacity however the workflow is designed for creating and looping multi-instrument music with your older Windows PC/laptop.
Individual bars can be copied and pasted and then grouped and looped over to create backing tracks.

## TODO
These are the things that need to be done before the application is "feature complete":
* Playback marker
* Loop bars
* Save
* Select BPM, currently fixed at 120
* Select beats per bar, currently set at 4
* Metronome
### Low priority
* Track playback volume
* Minimal effects - Eq, reverb, delay
* Touch based operation
* Pedal controls

## Limitations
Here are a list features that I'm not planning to implement:
* Guitar effects (instead, use something like a Boss GT-1).
* Synthesized instruments.
* Compositions with changing time signatures.

Pull requests are welcomed.
